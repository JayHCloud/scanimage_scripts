# **Scanimage Scripts**


The drivers for the Brother ADS 2000 allow you to make scripts that trigger when the scan button on the device is pressed. The drivers come with 4 default scripts that make use of scanimage to communicate with the device. The default scripts scan single-sided pages only and don't support using the automatic document feeder. I made some new ones to take advantage of all the scanners features. After scanning the scripts are set to move the scans to another folder, in my case a paperless-ngx instance for sorting and storage.
